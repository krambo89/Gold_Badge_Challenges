This project was entirely self funded, and was made possible thanks to copious amounts of coffee, help from several instructors, and divinly inspired patience/grace from the maintainer's Fiance

BUGS/FUTURE FIXES
-------------

Some aspects of this project are not fully realized such as:

We are also working on restructureing the string output for the menus to a more pleasing and user firendly format.
Finally we are also working on getting the monetary damages to read with "$" attached and read like currency. Currentl they will appear as simple decimals.

If there are any more bugs of issues with the program please forward questions on to krambo89@gmail.com.
