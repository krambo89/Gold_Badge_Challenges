Challenge 2 (Claims Challenge)

Claims Challenge is a Console app designed to manage the claims system for Komodo Insurance

Use:

You can use the app in a variety of ways.

First it can be utilized to simply bring up a list of the current claims on the claims list.
You can then choose to take care of any existing claims, which will pull the first claim from the top of the list. It will then prompt you to acccept the new claim before it dequeues it and sends it to you. 
You may also enter in a new claim. All relevent information will be required of you upon entering the new claim. Since Komodos policy is any claims filed 30 after the incident are invalid the system will label the new clame as such when you enter in your dates, so make sure to do so correctly.
Finally you also have the option to modify existing cliams.

This project was entirely self funded, and was made possible thanks to copious amounts of coffee, help from several instructors, and divinly inspired patience/grace from the maintainer's Fiance

BUGS/FUTURE FIXES
-------------

Some aspects of this project are not fully realized such as:

The DateTime output on the console also gives the time, defaulting to 12:00:00. We are working on removing this.
We are also working on restructureing the string output for the menus to a more pleasing and user firendly format.
Finally we are also working on getting the monetary damages to read with "$" attached and read like currency. Currentl they will appear as simple decimals.

If there are any more bugs of issues with the program please forward questions on to krambo89@gmail.com.
